                  <p>I reinvented myself when I decided to become a single mother. I was in an abusive marriage and chose to leave. With the unwavering support of a counselor, I learned about abuse and decided that I did not deserve to be mistreated. Also, I did not want my three sons to be victims or to perpetuate the cycle of abuse. I truly believed we deserved better. At the time of my decision, I had many concerns and worries. I was only working part-time, the boys were enrolled in private school, I owned a home and a car. I also had tremendous debt in my name.  I agonized about how the boys would survive the divorce. Thoughts and fears of negative reactions from my family and community caused stress as well. Somehow despite these worries, I pushed through with the divorce and have absolutely no regrets.</p>
                  <p>

                  My journey was not easy. Once I had the courage to serve the divorce papers, he had become even more abusive.  Using relentless threatening texts, disturbing phone calls, and withholding financial support as attempts to control, I was weary.   I became frightened and extremely protective of my sons. I did not share my experience with many, which resulted in isolation.  I felt very alone. The experience of divorce was saw raw, the thought of others gossiping and hurting my children was agonizing.  I did everything in my power to protect our vulnerability. </p>

                 <p>
                  Faced with layers of financial problems, bankruptcy, foreclosure, and raising three sons alone, I did not give up.   I worked on my issues and gradually separated the gray, blurred areas into black and white clear thinking. I cemented ideas and beliefs about myself which helped me believe I was worth it. With an angel on my shoulder every step of the way, seven years later, I saved our home, and the boys attend the schools of their choice.  Three years ago, I completed a post-masters leadership degree and work as a district administrator.  After working extremely hard keep their lives as stable as possible, my sons are thriving.  They are beautiful people who care about others and each other. Every day they demonstrate what it means to be healthy minded, well-adjusted young men.  I could not be more proud of them. I could not be more proud of myself for pushing through what seemed to be an impossible situation.</p>
                  <p>

                  With God’s grace, a supportive therapist, and a hunger for change, I have reinvented my life and the lives of my children.</p>
